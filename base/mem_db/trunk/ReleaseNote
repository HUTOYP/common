mem_db-4.1.0
------------
  new features:
    * fix bug for DeleteGeneralValue().
    * use scons/hudson to build the project.
    * remove EXPIRATION #ifdef; make EXPIRATION always the true.
    * fix bug that more-than-3-month-expiration setting failure.
    * add feature that failed servers will be automatically ejected after a number of retries.
    * add feature that auto ejected servers will recovery after dead timeout limit.
    * add complete comments for mem_db.conf and header files.
    * GetGenenelValue-->GetGeneralValue; and GetGenenelValue becomes DEPRECATED.
    * Support global expiration setting for all general k-v pair storage.
    * add support for auto loading configuration file.
  TODOs:
    * When auto_remove_failed_servers=0, if the memcached server A cracks down,
      it could not be accessed any more, even if the server A is recoverd. You just have to
      restart clients. However, auto-load-config feature is supplied to avoid the bugs. That
      to say, when you set auto_remove_failed_servers=0, you'd better set auto_load_config=1
      to reload configuration and rebuild mem_db instance periodically.
  May-be issues:
    * This version may be not compitable with former versions, because of remaing type of
      private variable of MemDB class. It's better to recompile related code to make sure
      everything is better.
